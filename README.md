# Basys3-UART

Within Lab 5, we will be creating a universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter on the Basys3 board with a baud rate of 9600 bits/s. The validity of the design will be tested by using PuTTy as our terminal emulator in which we will input ASCII characters of our last name. In this case, the ASCII characters to be sent are ‘M’, ‘A’, ‘R’, ‘Q’, ‘U’, ‘E’, ‘Z’.
